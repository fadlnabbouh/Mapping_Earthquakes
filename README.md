# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Overview 

The purpose of this repository was to use Javascript, Leaflet.js, and geoJSON data to map earthquake data from the last 7 days, major earthquakes, and tectonic plate data. Using Leaflet and Mapbox, I overlayed the earthquake and tectonic data on the world map, giving users the ability to toggle whether to show the data on the map or not. In addition, 3 types of map views were included from the mapbox database: street, satelitte, and dark to improve the user experience.
